# And-the-Oscar-goes-to...

Even though we already know the "Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything", calculated by an enormous supercomputer named Deep Thought over a period of 7.5 million years.  the answer is not particularly suitable to when it comes to an important question for all movie buffs. "Who's gonna win the Oscar?"
  
I don't wanna disturb "Deep Thought" with this trivial question. So I took it upon as a project with the help of machine learning algorithms to predict the Academy Awards (Oscar) winners for 2018.
