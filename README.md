# And-the-Oscar-goes-to...

Even though we already know [the answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aboZctrHfK8) to the "Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything", calculated by an enormous supercomputer named __Deep Thought__ over a period of 7.5 million years, it is not particularly helpful when it comes to an important question of all time.

## "Who's gonna win the Oscar?"
  
I thought of asking __Deep Thought"__. Well, you [know.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucKnpvPaAeM).

So I took this project to predict the Academy Awards (Oscar) winners for 2018 with the help of machine learning algorithms.
